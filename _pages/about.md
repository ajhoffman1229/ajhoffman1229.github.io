# My Background

My name is Alexander Hoffman. I'm a chemical engineer with expertise in computational heterogeneous catalysis, chemical kinetics, and machine learning. I earned my BS in Chemistry from the College of William and Mary in 2015, after which I worked at the EPA for a year. I realized that I wouldn't be able to make it far without a graduate degree, so I moved to sunny Gainesville, FL to attend the University of Florida. Initially, I intended only to get a MS in chemical engineering; however, I started doing research with [Prof. David Hibbitts](https://hibbitts.rc.ufl.edu/) and enjoyed it so much that I stayed for 4 more years than I had planned, earning my Ph.D. under his guidance in 2022. During my Ph.D., I worked on a variety of projects with many excellent experimental groups, namely the [Gounder group at Purdue University](https://sites.google.com/site/rgounder/), the [Schwartz group at University of Maine](https://thomasschwartz.wixsite.com/schwartzgroup), and the [Christopher group at UCSB](https://www.christophergroup.engineering.ucsb.edu/). After my Ph.D., I moved to Cambridge, MA to do postdoctoral research with [Prof. Rafa G&oacute;mez-Bombarelli](http://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/). At MIT, I've been lucky to work with [Prof. Yuriy Rom&aacute;n-Leshkov's group](https://www.romangroup.mit.edu/) and Dr. Manuel Moliner at [ITQ in Valencia](https://itq.upv-csic.es/en) to study zeolite synthesis. The work 

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy cooking, playing sports---tennis, running, basketball, and swimming---watching classic film, reading literature and non-fiction, listening to music, and spending time with my wife, Becca, and dog, Bella.

### Br&oslash;nsted Acid Zeolite Catalysts for Alcohol Dehydration

Much of my work during my Ph.D. focused on acid strength and alcohol dehydration chemistry in Br&oslash;nsted acid-form zeolites. I used purely theoretical metrics like deprotonation energy (DPE) and experimentally measurable values like ammonia binding energies to assess [how two nearby Br&oslash;nsted acid sites interact in CHA zeolites](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.8b02049) and [how sites on the surfaces of zeolites differ from those in the bulk in MFI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.3c00076). I also studied [methanol and ethanol dehydration reactions on pairs of nearby Br&oslash;nsted acid sites](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202007790), where I found that nearby coadsorbed species can for hydrogen bonds with sites where reactions occur, and [studied the effects of molecular clustering on methanol dehydration on single sites in CHA](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021951719305111). These studies of methanol and ethanol dehydration were done in collaboration with Raj Gounder's group. I also worked with a master's student in the Hibbitts group, Tsung-wei Liu, and the Schwartz group to study [hydroxymethyl furfural and ethanol cross-etherification in BEA zeolites](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.0c01328). I was also momentarily preoccupied by [issues with the default structure of MFI from the IZA database and how it can misbehave during some calculations](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b12230). This paper (my first first-author paper) taught me the importance of using the right models for calculations in VASP!

### Supported Rh Catalysts for Pollution Abatement

My second major project during my Ph.D. was on Rh catalysts for NO<sub>x</sub> reduction. I worked with the Christopher group at UCSB to characterize [Rh nanoparticles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c05160) and [single-atoms](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c02813) on &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> supports. Rh can be particularly frustrating to work with because it reversibly aggregates to nanoparticles and disperses to single-atoms on oxide supports; as such, the active sites for NO<sub>x</sub> reduction can change over the course of the reaction. These projects sparked my interest in single-atom metal catalysts and the promise they provide for maximizing precious metal use and tailoring the behavior of active sites.

### Controlling Zeolite synthesis

I did some work studying zeolite synthesis during my Ph.D. in collaboration with the Gounder group&mdash;in particular, analyzing the way that [Al is substituted near one another in MFI and which of those pairs are titrated by Co<sup>2+</sup>](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c03154) and [how tetrabutyl ammonium and tetrapropyl ammonium co-occlude with Na<sup>+</sup> during MEL and MFI synthesis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c01083). However, my work during my Ph.D. used exclusively density functional theory (DFT) to characterize materials and study reaction mechanisms, but these tools can only model relatively small systems, relatively short time-scales, and are generally too slow to rapidly screen the full materials space that heterogeneous catalysts occupy. Therefore, I moved to MIT to work with Rafa G&oacute;mez-Bombarelli to learn more about machine learning (ML) methods as they pertain to zeolite synthesis and other computational chemistry challenges. I have several papers in the works related to ML to understand and control zeolite synthesis better.

# The Next Steps

My work as a PI will continue to use tools that I learned about during my Ph.D. and postdoc and apply them to problems related to catalysis for sustainability. I am particularly interested in applications of ML to address issues of plastics and air pollution.
